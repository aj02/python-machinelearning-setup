# Overview

This repository contains setup instructions for various python machine learning environments I use. Since a lot of people/computers have to replicate my environments quite often, I have tried to put detailed instructions in one place (here). It mainly cover

* [How to setup your python programming environment in a replicable manner](https://github.com/soumendra/python-machinelearning-setup/blob/master/setup_environments.md)
* [How to set up your aws instance from scratch](https://github.com/soumendra/python-machinelearning-setup/blob/master/setup_aws.md)
    - AMIs are great, but sometimes there is no good fit
    - Most often, even when I'm using an AMI with preloaded software, I still have to configure a few things (and I like setting up my own conda enviroment - see the guide above)
    - You can also follow this to set up your brand new Ubuntu installation
* [How to setup your Ubuntu/MacOS system for Computer Vision (mainly OpenCV3](https://github.com/soumendra/python-machinelearning-setup/blob/master/setup_computer_vision.md))
* [How to set up Spark in Ubuntu/MacOS](https://github.com/soumendra/python-machinelearning-setup/blob/master/setup_spark.md)
* [ToDo] Setting up an AWS instance for deep learning using an AMI
* [ToDo] Setting up an AWS cluster for deep learning with TensorFlow
* [ToDo] Automation of AWS workflow with Boto3
* [ToDo] A guide persisting data (secondary EBS volumes) and code (GitHub) for AWS
* [ToDo] Create a GitBook
